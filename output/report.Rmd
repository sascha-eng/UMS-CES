## Introduction

[tbd: what this work is about]

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # Load the tidyverse package

# import dataset

ess_1 <- ess %>% 
  select(idno, vote, polintr, gndr, agea, domicil, region, eisced, eduyrs, cntry, ctzcntr) %>%  # select variables
  filter(cntry == "CH") %>%  # restrict sample to Switzerland
  filter(ctzcntr == 1) %>% # restrict sample to Swiss citizens 
  filter(vote %in% c(1,2)) %>%  # restrict to "yes" and "no" votes
  filter(!polintr %in% c(7,8,9)) %>%  # exclude values 7, 8, and 9

## Methods

Y-variable: 
* `vote` - Voted last national election
  + 1	Yes
  + 2	No
  + 3	Not eligible to vote
  + 7	Refusal (missing value)
  + 8	Don't know (missing value)
  + 9	No answer (missing value)

X-Variable:
* `polintr` - How interested in politics
  + 1	Very interested
  + 2	Quite interested
  + 3	Hardly interested
  + 4	Not at all interested
  + 7	Refusal (missing value)
  + 8	Don't know (missing value)
  + 9	No answer (missing value)
* `gndr` - Gender
  + 1	Male
  + 2	Female
  + 9	No answer (missing value)
* `agea` - Age of respondent, calculated
  + age as numer
  + 999	Not available (missing value)
* `domicil` - Domicile, respondent's description
  + 1	A big city
  + 2	Suburbs or outskirts of big city
  + 3	Town or small city
  + 4	Country village
  + 5	Farm or home in countryside
  + 7	Refusal (missing value)
  + 8	Don't know (missing value)
  + 9	No answer (missing value)

```{r}
# some summary statistics
summary(ess_1)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ess_1) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(vote, polintr))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
